# 🎬 IMDb SQL Mini Project

This project analyzes an IMDb-style movie database using SQL concepts in a Kaggle Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview
Using a mock SQLite `.db` file uploaded to Kaggle, I performed SQL queries to uncover insights from three interconnected tables:
- `movies`
- `ratings`
- `genres`
The goal was to practice:
- SQL `JOIN` operations
- Window functions like `RANK()`
- Aggregations (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`)
- Subqueries and filtering

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed
- 🎖️ Top 3 rated movies per genre (`RANK()` + `PARTITION BY`)
- 🧮 Average movie rating per decade
- 🗳️ Most voted movie each year
- 🔗 Merging movie details with ratings and genres using `JOIN`s
- 🏷️ Most common and highest-rated genres

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- SQL (SQLite syntax)
- Python (Pandas, SQLite3)
- Kaggle Notebooks
